Start a new Ralph Loop for this task: {{args}}

## Instructions

1. Create the .ralph-state/ directory if it doesn't exist

2. Create .ralph-state/state.json with this structure:
   - id: loop-<current-timestamp>
   - status: running
   - goal: <the task from args>
   - iteration: 1
   - maxIterations: 100
   - completionPromise: COMPLETE
   - startTime: <current ISO timestamp>
   - lastUpdate: <current ISO timestamp>
   - notes: ["Loop started"]

3. Create empty .ralph-state/history.json with: { "iterations": [] }

4. Analyze the task and create an implementation plan

5. Begin working on the first step

6. After completing each step, update state.json:
   - Increment iteration
   - Update lastUpdate
   - Add note about what was done

7. Continue working until complete, then output: <done>COMPLETE</done>

Remember: Your files persist between iterations. Always check existing files before creating new ones.
